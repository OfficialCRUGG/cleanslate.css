# cleanslate.css

Opinionated CSS Reset that resets essentially everything to a clean slate. Headings are all the same size and weight, links are not styled, etc.

Heavily inspired by Tailwind's preflight styles.

## Usage

### npm Package

For frameworks like React, Svelte, etc.

```bash
npm install cleanslate.css
pnpm install cleanslate.css
yarn add cleanslate.css
bun install cleanslate.css
```

```ts
import "cleanslate.css";
```

### CDN

For static sites, etc.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cleanslate.css/cleanslate.min.css">
<!-- Or, if you, for whatever reason, don't what the minified version: -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cleanslate.css/cleanslate.css">
```

## License

Due to the simplicity of this project, the styles would - according to my knowledge (I'm not a lawyer) - not be eligible for copyright. Therefore, I release this project into the public domain under the Unlicense.
